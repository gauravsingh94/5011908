## Understand Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node has a reference to the next node in the list.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has references to both the previous and next nodes in the list.

### Analysis

#### Analyze the Time Complexity of Each Operation
- **Add**: `O(n)` - linear time complexity
- **Search**: `O(n)` - linear time complexity
- **Traverse**: `O(n)` - linear time complexity
- **Delete**: `O(n)` - linear time complexity
