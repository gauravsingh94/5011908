## Understand Search Algorithms

- **Linear Search**: Iterates through each element in the list until it finds the target element.
- **Binary Search**: Divides the sorted list in half until it finds the target element.

### Analysis

#### Compare the Time Complexity of Linear and Binary Search
- **Linear Search**: `O(n)` - linear time complexity
- **Binary Search**: `O(log n)` - logarithmic time complexity

#### Discuss When to Use Each Algorithm Based on the Data Set Size and Order
- Use **linear search** for small data sets or when the data is unsorted.
- Use **binary search** for large data sets that are sorted.
