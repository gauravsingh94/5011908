## Why Data Structures and Algorithms are Essential in Handling Large Inventories

- Data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories because they enable efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. This is crucial in an inventory management system where products need to be quickly added, updated, or deleted.

### Suitable Data Structures

- **ArrayList**: for storing products in a linear sequence
- **HashMap**: for storing products with a unique identifier (productId) as the key

### Analysis

Analyze the time complexity of each operation:

- **Add**: `O(1)` - constant time complexity
- **Update**: `O(1)` - constant time complexity
- **Delete**: `O(1)` - constant time complexity
