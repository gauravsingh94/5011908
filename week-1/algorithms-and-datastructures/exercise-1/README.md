Inventory Management System
Why Data Structures and Algorithms Matter
Data structures and algorithms are crucial in handling large inventories because they enable:
Efficient storage
Quick retrieval
Easy manipulation of data
In an inventory management system, products need to be added, updated, or deleted rapidly. Data structures and algorithms make this possible.
Suitable Data Structures
ArrayList: stores products in a linear sequence
HashMap: stores products with a unique identifier (productId) as the key
Analysis
Time Complexity of Operations
Operation	Time Complexity
Add	O(1) - constant time complexity
Update	O(1) - constant time complexity
Delete	O(1) - constant time complexity
