## Solution to the Exercise

### Step 1: Understand Asymptotic Notation

#### Big O Notation
- **Big O notation** is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. In the context of algorithms, Big O notation is used to classify algorithms based on their performance or complexity.

#### Best, Average, and Worst-case Scenarios
- **Best-case scenario**: The minimum time an algorithm takes to complete.
- **Average-case scenario**: The average time an algorithm takes to complete for a given input size.
- **Worst-case scenario**: The maximum time an algorithm takes to complete.

### Analysis

#### Compare the Time Complexity of Linear and Binary Search Algorithms
- **Linear Search**: `O(n)` - linear time complexity
- **Binary Search**: `O(log n)` - logarithmic time complexity

Binary search is more suitable for the e-commerce platform because it has a faster time complexity, making it more efficient for large datasets. However, binary search requires the products to be sorted, which may not always be the case. Linear search, on the other hand, can be used on unsorted data but is slower for large datasets.
