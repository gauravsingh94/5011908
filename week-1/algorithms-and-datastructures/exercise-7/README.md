## Understand Recursive Algorithms

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It can simplify certain problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems.

### Analysis

#### Discuss the Time Complexity of Your Recursive Algorithm
- The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is `O(years)`, where `years` is the number of years for which the future value is being predicted.

#### Explain How to Optimize the Recursive Solution to Avoid Excessive Computation
- **Memoization**: Store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems and solve each sub-problem only once.
